and\\nthird\\nquarter, 2024.\\nAll participants will be in the listen-only mode.\\nShould you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the \\nstar\\nkey followed by zero.\\nWe will facilitate a question and answer session towards the end of this \\npresentation.\\nSuppose a question at any time, please press star, then one on your touch-tone \\nphone.\\nI would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Mr. Martin \\nJerozick\\nwith CF Investor Relations.\\nSir, please proceed.\\nGood morning, and thanks for joining the CF Industries Earnings Conference Call.\\nWith me today are Tony Will, President and CEO, Chris Bone, Executive Vice \\nPresident and\\nChief Operating Officer, Bert Frost, Executive Vice President of Sales, Market \\nDevelopment\\nand Supply Chain, and Greg Cameron, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial \\nOfficer.\\nCF Industries reported its results for the first nine months and third quarter of \\n2024\\nyesterday afternoon.\\nOn this call, we will review the results, discuss our outlook, and then host a \\nquestion and\\nanswer session.\\nStatements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not \\nhistorical facts\\nare forward-looking statements.\\nThese statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, \\nuncertainties,\\nand assumptions that are difficult to predict.\\nTherefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed\\nor\\nimplied in any statements.\\nMore detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be \\nfound in\\nour filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.\\nAlso you will find the reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAP measures in the \\npress release\\nand presentation posted on our website.\\nNow let me introduce Tony Will.\\nThanks Martin and good morning everyone.\\nHere in the organization that prides itself on unparalleled operational excellence,\\nour\\nasset utilization and our safety statistics are truly world-class.\\nAnd so it is with great sadness that I have to report in early October we lost a \\nmember\\nof our team at Donaldsonville, Louisiana due to a fatal vehicular accident.\\nOur thoughts are with and our hearts go out to as family, friends, and colleagues.\\nThis is a tragic reminder about why we put safety first and the importance of not \\nbeing\\nsatisfied, who are becoming complacent with historical performance, but are in need\\nto\\nremain focused on the present in everything that we do.\\nI am confident our team will learn from this tragedy as we work together to ensure \\nall\\n\\n\\n\\nour colleagues remain safe every day.\\nTurning to earnings, yesterday afternoon we posted results for the third quarter of\\n2024\\nwhich we generated at just a beat of $511 million.\\nThis brought a just a beat of the first nine months of the year to $1.7 billion.\\nAdditionally already the data cash flow conversion efficiency remains strong and we\\nended the\\nquarter with more cash on the balance sheet than we began with, even after \\nreturning $580\\nmillion to shareholders through Sherry purchases and dividends.\\nWe are very pleased with where our business is today.\\nOur team is operating well.\\nGlobal nitrogen demand remains consistently strong and we continue to make progress\\nin\\nour strategic initiatives.\\nWith that I will turn it over to Chris to provide more details in our operating \\nresults.\\nChris.\\nThanks Tony.\\nOur manufacturing and distribution teams managed operations well through an event \\nfilled third\\nquarter as we performed our highest level of planned turnaround activities for the \\nyear.\\nWe also experienced minor production impacts in Louisiana from Hurricane Francine \\nin\\nSeptember.\\nOur Donald Saville and Wegman teams did an outstanding job safely shutting down and\\nstarting up\\nthose facilities, limiting the downtime from the storm.\\nDespite these events, our ammonia utilization rate for the third quarter was 93%.\\nFor the full year we continue to expect to produce approximately 9.8 million tons \\nof\\ngross ammonia.\\nOur strategic initiatives continue to advance.\\nConstruction of the dehydration and compression unit for our Donald Saville carbon \\ncapture\\nand sequestering project is on track.\\nStart up for sequestration by ExxonMobil and 45Q tax credit generation is expected \\nin 2025.\\nAdditionally, commissioning of our green ammonia project at Donald Saville \\ncontinues.\\nFinally, our evaluation of a greenfield low carbon ammonia plan is advancing well.\\nWith a final investment decision expected in early 2025, we are nearing completion \\nof\\nour auto thermal reforming ammonia plant feed study, giving us greater clarity on \\nthe capital\\nrequired to construct new capacity.\\nAlongside this, we continue to have productive discussions with our potential \\nequity partners,\\nother interested parties that continue to emerge and prospective long term off take\\npartners.\\nWe continue to assess where the global nitrogen supply demand balance will be when \\na new plant\\nwould come online.\\nAs we look at it today, we expect a tightening global market over the next few \\nyears as projected\\nnew capacity growth does not keep pace with demand growth for traditional \\napplications,\\nmuch less for new clean energy applications.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith that, let me turn it over to Burt to discuss the global nitrogen market.\\nThanks, Chris.\\nOur team had an active quarter that has positioned us well for the rest of 2024.\\nOur UAN and ammonia fill programs were well received by customers and achieved our \\ntargets.\\nWe then continue to take new orders as global prices rose, pushing the order book \\nwell into\\nfourth quarter.\\nThis has resulted in much lower than normal inventory in our system, and we believe\\ninventory\\nis low throughout the North American nitrogen channel as well.\\nStrong uptake in our fill programs suggests good demand for nitrogen in the months \\nahead,\\nincluding for fall ammonia applications if weather cooperates.\\nDespite U.S. crop prices that are under pressure from projected large harvests, \\ntoday's nitrogen\\nprices continue to represent good value for farmers.\\nAs a result, we currently expect North American planted acres in 2025 across all \\nmajor crops\\nwill be similar to this year.\\nGlobally, the nitrogen supply demand balance continues to be constructive.\\nUrea exports from China are 90 percent lower through September than the prior year,\\nand\\nit is unclear when Chinese producers will be allowed to resume exports.\\nAdditionally, lack of natural gas for nitrogen producers in Trinidad and Egypt \\nreduced available\\nsupply in the third quarter at a time when we typically see length in the global \\nmarket.\\nAt the same time, demand has been robust.\\nBrazil and India both appear to have significant Urea import requirements to be met\\nthrough\\nthe first quarter of 2025.\\nWe also have seen strong demand from smaller importing countries.\\nThese include Australia, Thailand, Mexico, and Turkey, among others, that have \\nincreased\\nconsumption over their three-year averages.\\nAgainst this backdrop, our manufacturing network remains firmly positioned below \\nend of the\\nglobal cost curve.\\nBefore an energy curve continues to suggest substantial energy spreads between \\nNorth America\\nand Europe, where the industry's marginal high-cost production is located.\\nAs a result, we expect attractive margin opportunities globally for our business in\\nthe near and\\nlonger term.\\nWith that, Greg will cover our financial performance.\\nThanks, Bert.\\nFor the first nine months of 2024, the company reported net earnings attributable \\nto common\\nstockholders of approximately $890 million, or $4.86 per diluted chair.\\nIbadah and adjusted Ibadah were both over $1.7 billion.\\nWith the third quarter of 2024, the company reported net earnings attributable to \\ncommon\\nstockholders of approximately $276 million, or $1.55 per diluted chair.\\nIbadah and adjusted Ibadah were approximately $510 million.\\nAs you can see on slide five, our third quarter results benefited from higher \\naverage selling\\nprices, which were driven by our ammonia segment, and lower realized gas costs when\\ncompared\\n\\n\\n\\nto the third quarter of 2023.\\nOver the past 12 months, our net cash from operations was $2.3 billion.\\nIn free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion.\\nOur free cash flow to adjusted Ibadah conversion rate remained strong at \\napproximately 65%.\\nThis cash flow enables us to return substantial capital to our shareholders through\\nshare\\nrepurchases and dividends.\\nSince the start of 2024, we have repurchased nearly 15 million shares for more than\\n$1.1\\nbillion, reducing our share count by 7.5% over that time.\\nWe have just under $1.5 billion remaining on our current share repurchase \\nauthorization,\\nwhich we intend to complete before its expiration in December of 2025.\\nBased on our current market capitalization, this gives us the capacity to \\nrepurchase about\\n10% of our outstanding shares through the end of next year.\\nAfter that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.\\nThanks, Greg.\\nBefore we move on to your questions, I want to thank the entire team here at CF for\\ntheir\\nhard work and contributions in the third quarter.\\nIn what is typically our seasonally lowest volume and price quarter, their efforts \\nenabled\\nus to generate enough cash to cover capital expenditures, return nearly $600 \\nmillion to\\nshareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and end the quarter with more\\ncash\\nthan we began.\\nWe remain positive about the near and longer term outlook for the company.\\nGlobal nitrogen dynamics remain consistently strong.\\nLonger term discipline investments in low carbon ammonia production provide a \\nrobust growth\\nplatform for the company.\\nTaken together, we expect to continue to drive strong cash generation and create \\nsubstantial\\nvalue for shareholders.\\nWith that operator, we will now open the call to questions.\\nThank you.\\nPeople now begin the question and answer session.\\nTo ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touchstone phone.\\nThe first question comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nThat was interesting.\\nSo, Tony, guys, when I take a step back and look at the supply-to-band dynamics, \\nyou've\\nlower supply out of China, Europe, some gas issues, and Trinidad, Egypt, et cetera,\\net\\ncetera, demand is pretty solid.\\nTony, when you take a step back and look at the current dynamics in 2025, your \\nperspective\\nis cash flow versus, obviously, some uncertainty regarding U.S.O. and G, because \\nparty-only\\ntowards the end of the decade.\\nHow do you calibrate your own thought process in terms of allocating that capital \\nin terms\\nof the cash, or if you push respectively, generate it in the next six to 12 months \\nto\\nbasically build out your network for the rest of the decade?\\n\\n\\n\\nAny thoughts that would be very helpful?\\nYeah, Chris, I would say we have a bias towards deploying capital back into the \\nbusiness for\\ngrowth if we find projects that we think can earn a rate of return that's above our\\ncost\\nof capital.\\nSo, our bias is definitely toward growth as a first step, and then certainly \\nreturning\\nexcess cash to shareholders.\\nAs Greg said during his remarks, we have just under $1.5 billion left under a \\nSherry\\nPurchase authorization, and we expect to be able to complete that by the end of \\nnext\\nyear, and that should drive an incremental approximately 10 percent accretion in \\nterms\\nof our shares.\\nAnd so, we're excited about both the growth aspect as well as our ability to take \\nshares\\nout of marketplace, and both of those things we think will drive value for \\nshareholders.\\nGo ahead.\\nJust a quick follow-up.\\nOnce again, just taking a step back, you have the first quarter obviously of some \\nwhich\\nare storms of third quarter, obviously hurricane surge, and avoid it a long time, \\nand there\\nare some things that are going to be happening in the next year.\\nWhen I look into 2025 and 2026, do you think turnaround activity will be the same \\nlevel,\\nslightly lower in terms of how much more could you have maximized profitability \\nbased on\\nthe current nitrogen price tech without all those outages and how we should think \\nabout\\nthat framework heading in next year?\\nThe storm freeze off that we had in the first quarter or the hurricane outages that\\nwe had\\nin the third quarter, but the operations team tries to manage our turnaround \\nactivity to\\nbe relatively consistent year on year on year, so we're not throwing the system way\\nup and\\nway down, but we're trying to level load it.\\nNow that's not always possible because of the timing of when things come, and we do\\nhave a couple of larger plants that when they go through turnaround have a \\nnoticeably bigger\\nimpact, but I would say we pretty much year in and year out going forward should be\\nproducing\\nin the neighborhood of about 10 million tons of ammonia and then will upgrade.\\nAs much of that is our upgrade system can manage.\\nAnd then the other piece of it to think about is we get into next year is we'll \\nbegin generating\\non an annualized basis an incremental roughly 100 million dollars of cash through \\nthe 45\\nQ tax credit as we start sequestering CO2, so that's on top of the base business \\nand\\nagain we're pretty excited about what that looks like.\\nThank you so much.\\nThank you.\\nThe next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, thank you.\\nYour press release provides this gross margin for nutrient tons for product.\\nAlways very interesting and the one that just jumps out is your DEF and was just \\ncurious\\nwhether what your view is on the outlook for DEF and maybe more specifically this \\nproblem\\nthat occurs with crystallization and so forth.\\nIs that poor quality DEF?\\nIs that all DEF?\\nDoes that affect you and is there a resolution of that down the road?\\nGood morning Steve, this is Byrne and regarding your question on DEF and the \\nopportunity for\\nCF we've continued investing that business since we acquired Terra in 2010 and it \\nhas been\\nan exciting path and growth vehicle for us where we're projected to be close to \\n800,000 tons\\nof equivalent product that trades at a substantial margin increase over granular \\nurea.\\nSo what we've done is when we looked at our platform we have capacity in several of\\nour\\nplants, Courtyard, Yazoo City, Woodward and the substantial capacity in \\nDonaldsonville and\\nwhich we're augmenting and has added to the system with rail cars.\\nSo the exciting part about DEF is the dosage rate because when we first acquired \\nthis business\\nit was at a fairly low percentage and what it was cutting out in terms of pollution\\nwhere\\ntoday the projections on dosing rate increases to five and even higher than that \\npercent\\njust looks at the doubling where we're projecting that the DEF could demand just in\\nNorth America\\ncould be in excess of three million urea equivalent tons and that's from zero in \\n2010.\\nSo for us this is a good platform that works very well into our system and we're \\ngoing\\nto continue to grow with it. Regarding the crystallization I'll have Chris answer \\nthat.\\nYes Steve, related to that there's very high specs required for DEF and the product\\nand\\nwe haven't experienced any of that. I think the one thing that we've seen is we've \\nalways\\nbeen very diligent about our testing requirements for that so the issue you bring \\nup we're not\\nall that familiar with because it hasn't affected any of our product.\\nVery good and I'd like to ask a little bit about the Donaldsonville project that \\nyou're\\nworking with Exxon West. Do you have any visibility on when they can get a classic\\ninjection well? Is that just an unknown and does that prevent you from essentially \\nlining\\nup customers for this and or do your customers need to invest on their own site, \\nsee if they're\\nfor storage or to use it as a fuel. I'm just curious if this moves forward in some \\ntime in\\n2025 are you going to be in a position where you could start loading a marine ship?\\nIn other\\nwords thanks. Yes so we are confident that in 2025 we'll be one sequestering CO2 \\nand two receiving\\nthe 45Q tax benefit. One of the reasons we chose Exxon as our partner is really \\njust the vast\\n\\n\\n\\nflexibility and alternatives they have if you recall their acquisition of the \\nformer\\nDenbury pipeline which is almost a thousand miles of CO2 pipeline gives them quite \\na bit of access\\nto more than a point-to-point storage wealth so they could have wells that they \\nhave in\\nthe queue right now from Louisiana all the way to Texas and all along that route. \\nSo our\\nconfidence level still remains very high. As I said we're doing a lot of work on \\nour side\\nof the fence and Exxon is actually doing a lot of work in piping on their side of \\nthe\\nfence to connect. So our confidence level remains high there. As far as being \\nprepared to load\\nvessels and ship out whether it be to Europe or Asia we expect that to be occurring\\nnext year\\nbased on what Burt's team decides is the best use for that particular low carbon \\nproduct.\\nAnd I would add to that Steve that on the system side we've spent a lot of time and\\neffort putting\\nin place all of the necessary system and controls and accounting procedures to be \\nable to not only\\nget the 45Q credit but be able to accurately score and certify a carbon intensity \\non\\nour production. And so that will be kind of among the first tons out there with an \\nactual\\ncarbon score associated with it.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\nWe have Josh Spector from UBS with the next question.\\nCan you see it?\\nYeah, good morning. I wonder if you talk a little bit about current nitrogen \\ndynamics.\\nThere were some comments the other day about warmer weather being an issue for \\nammonia applications\\nin the U.S. later in the quarter. And some comments that activity today is slow.\\nI don't know if you've had any different characterization of the market today. And \\nwhen you talk about\\ntighter inventory in North America is that something we should expect to \\nmaterialize in higher prices\\nin the spring or do you have any different view about how that impacts the market?\\nThanks.\\nGood morning, Josh. So regarding the current dynamics, I would say constructive. In\\nthat,\\nwhen you go around the world where we are on supply is, as I mentioned earlier, the\\nabsence\\nof Chinese tons available to the market is a 3 to 5 million ton pull which could be\\nup to 10%\\nof global seaborne traded product. And then you go through different places that \\nhave experienced gas issues\\nor high cost gas issues like in Europe where we've seen Yara and others take \\nproduction offline.\\nYou have, I would say, an appropriate or limited supply basis right now.\\nAnd then when you look at demand with India stepping in for another tender and \\nasking for a million tons\\nto be shipped by middle December and then continued demand in South America and \\nBrazil and Argentina,\\nthen you'll roll into Q1 for the Northern Hemisphere and we believe that the US and\\nEurope are behind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so where we are as a company, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that our \\ninventory is limited.\\nIt is. When you look at what has been imported and what has been exported for a net\\nbalance\\nand then what we and we think others lost in production, we think the nitrogen \\nsupply and inventories,\\nwhether that be with retailers or with producers, is limited. And so that sets up a\\npositive environment\\nas we head into application season for the spring. Now regarding your question \\nabout fall application,\\nthat is a due to start about now. Fall application, the pneumonia, our ambient \\ntemperature and soil temperature\\nare about 50 degrees. We're hitting close with that in the Northern tier. We've had\\na very good season in Canada\\nand that as the weather moves south and gets cooler, we'll see those applications \\npick up.\\nThe commentary about limited or limiting applications possibly has been soil \\nmoisture, not necessarily temperature.\\nAnd so what you need for a healthy ammonia season is appropriate soil moisture for \\nthe ammonia to bind in the soil\\nand that is what we're looking for as these rain patterns sweep across the Northern\\ntier in Iowa,\\nthen you'll see applications take off. Over the last several years, applications \\nhave gone well into December.\\nAnd that's the case, our order book, which we believe is in a very good position.\\nWe've positioned products in our terminals. They're ready to go.\\nThat will have a good season, probably a better season than last year. And so, and \\nwe have those orders already in the system.\\nThanks. It's a helpful context. I'll pass it on.\\nThank you. The next question comes from Joelle Jackson with BMO capital markets. \\nPlease go ahead.\\nJust a couple questions. First, a little short term. Maybe I'm telling you with \\nthis last question.\\nTypically, you do more sales in Q4 than in Q3. I think it's in five years in a row \\nof a higher Q4 than in Q3.\\nAny reason not to expect that this year?\\nIn terms of how we take orders and then move those tons through the system and as \\nsales, each year is different.\\nAnd so the fill programs tend to take place either in late Q2 or early Q3. This \\nyear was early Q3.\\nWe built our order book and then continued to take additional orders on top of that\\nfill program.\\nSo today, our order book, as I said in my prepare remarks, is healthy through Q4.\\nAnd we're going to start taking Q1 orders shortly based on our price expectations.\\nAnd so, regarding whether it's bigger or smaller Q4, Q3, we don't look at it that \\nway.\\nWe look at what we've got, our production rates, our allocations to tons, and we \\nmove the tons out in an orderly fashion.\\nAnd then on the Greenfield Blue Amone project that you're expecting the feed \\nstudies on by the end of the year,\\nany color you can give may be higher level, what you need to still get this \\napproved, your partner's capital running three or four billion.\\nDo you think that's still reasonable?\\nAnything to pick up and comment to the last couple of months, give us an idea of \\nwhat we could expect early next year\\nand some of your decision-making processes?\\nYeah, I mean, I think the number in the neighborhood of four billion dollars on \\nland is, you know, an approximate number.\\nWe're finalizing the feed study and that should narrow the range a little bit to \\n\\n\\n\\nkind of a plus minus 10 percent range.\\nBut I think, you know, as the numbers are kind of rolling up with a bit more \\nuncertainty, ranging four billion is where we think it's going to come in.\\nAnd at that kind of number, we do think that, you know, that it is a project that \\nmakes sense, particularly given what Chris was saying\\nabout longer term the projected growth of nitrogen demand, even in traditional \\napplications exceeds what the new capacity brought online is.\\nAnd, you know, that's before you get into some of the capacity shutdowns that we're\\nexpecting to continue to happen in Europe and some other places.\\nAnd, you know, the partners that we're having conversations with, I think are \\nsimilarly comfortable being able to invest in a project in that kind of range and \\nlook at a return profile that is, you know, is disfavorable.\\nSo, for us to get there, you know, we need to finish up the feed study.\\nWe need to try to get the partnership agreements and all of the, you know, ongoing \\ngovernance and everything kind of put together.\\nAnd then it's going to be a decision for the board ultimately to make.\\nBut we're targeting kind of, you know, middle first quarter of next year to be in a\\nposition to.\\nMake that decision.\\nYeah, the only thing I would add to that, Joel, this is Chris, is that, you know, \\nas we look at our partnership selection, you have brought that up and part of the \\nquestion.\\nWe actually have a lot of benefits related to that.\\nWe have our Japanese equity counterparts that we're in discussions with.\\nBut as Tony mentioned, you know, recently even more industrials, primarily due to \\nsome of the energy, you know, issues going on, primarily in Europe.\\nAre also stepping in to understand the project dynamics.\\nAnd in all cases, sort of the capital number range that Tony's putting out there, \\nthey all seem ready to move forward with the project as well on those type of \\ncapital parameters.\\nTony, if I could just get one more in on that.\\nI may have missed totally misunderstood that.\\nBut are you suggesting that the economics of the plant around $4 billion might be \\njustifiable, even if some of the clean ammonia map and benefits weren't there?\\nI may have misunderstood that if that's what you were trying to get at.\\nYeah, I mean, I think the way that we're looking at it, Chris, is, or Joel, I'm \\nsorry, is that with, you know, with an average sale price, you know, you're going \\nto be able to get it.\\nAnd then the sale price in the neighborhood of 450 metric ton, along with the 45 Q \\nbenefit that we would expect to be able to generate.\\nThat should earn a reasonable rate of return on, you know, the kind of investment \\nthat we're looking at making here.\\nWe believe, I mean, if you look at the market today, it's well above that.\\nNow it is, you know, it does move around.\\nAnd when you see a new plant come on, like Gulf Coast ammonia or whatever, there is\\ngoing to be some lumpiness and some volatility.\\nBut as we project forward, we expect a tightening and the SMD balance, even in \\ntraditional applications.\\nAnd we think the market is going to support that kind of a price.\\nAnd so even before you get to new applications for Queen ammonia, there's an \\nargument to be made that that plant is just viable.\\nI think if we are successful in bringing on a couple of, you know, of the potential\\npartners that we are deeply in discussions with that want to take some of that \\nproduction into brand new applications,\\nit even justifies it further.\\nSo again, we're very optimistic about the return profile of what this plant looks \\nlike.\\nThank you.\\nThank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have the next question from Richard Garcharino with Wells Fargo.\\nPlease go ahead.\\nAll right.\\nThanks.\\nGood morning, everyone.\\nFirst question on the nitrogen market outlook, you know, you pointed out counties, \\nyour re-exports, basically now expected less than a million tons this year.\\nWhat do you think is going on there in terms of how the China government is \\nthinking?\\nIs this something that may be extended indefinitely?\\nAnd, you know, that supports your comments on the much more tighter outlook going \\nforward?\\nMaybe that's the first question.\\nWhen you look at China over the last 20, 25 years, we've seen many different \\nChina's in terms of being the world's largest importer of Urea in the 90s to \\nentering the export market in the early 2000s to overwhelming the world market with\\nalmost 14 million tons of exportable tons in 2015-16 to slowly ramping that down to\\n9 to 7 to 5 to 3 to 2.\\nNow eliminated, it's been a surprise and something that's not easy to predict \\nbecause as many things are happening in China, some of those are opaque or \\ngovernmental decisions.\\nToday, the expectation is, at least from the investor communities, then the next \\nquarter they're coming, the next quarter they're coming, well they haven't.\\nAnd I think part of that's a reflection of what's going on in China.\\nYou're seeing growth in demand.\\nToday, it looks like demand for industrial and ag applications are close to 60 \\nmillion tons.\\nThat's 6-0.\\nThat's a gigantic consumer of Urea.\\nAnd most of that is produced using coal or imported, domestic coal or imported \\ncoal.\\nSo I think for the Chinese government, they want to keep that product available for\\ntheir consumers, their farmers, to make the food that they want to make and make \\nthat at a reasonable cost.\\nTo me, that's a rational decision-making process when you're exporting for almost \\nzero value to the world, or at least to China, and subsidizing the world with cheap\\nUrea.\\nAnd so another parallel path on this has been the exported tons of ammonium sulfate\\nout of China that have grown substantially from several million tons to, I think, \\nclose to 16-17 million tons.\\nA lot of that going to Brazil and secondary markets, that's a lot of nitrogen \\nthat's still going out of China.\\nAnd so I think the market is seeming to project that they'll be able to export tons\\nin 2025.\\nThat remains to be seen and we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\\nGreat, thanks.\\nAnd then as a follow-up, just on the clean energy projects, I was just curious, as \\nyou work through the feed study and you look at the environment, and right now, \\nwhat's your view in terms of the announced proposed capacity that's supposed to be \\ncoming out from various different companies and startups?\\nWell, you know, the proposed capacity is supposed to be out there for the ammonia.\\nWhat do you think is the likelihood that maybe half that comes online, maybe a \\nquarter, or any high level of use on that?\\nThank you.\\nYeah, I think as we look at those announcements, you have to look at them and \\nassess probabilities related to them.\\nSo it was two years ago, we ran all the projects that had been announced globally \\nthat were low carbon, and there was over 107 projects of which we thought maybe \\nless than 10 would actually be built, I would say.\\n\\n\\n\\nOut of that list, I would say it's probably even fewer than that going forward.\\nSo those projects, the nice thing about our industry is you have pretty good \\nvisibility into new projects, starting given the engineering firms that have worked\\non them, and then also the timeline to build one is four to four and a half years, \\nso that also provides you an understanding of what happens with the S&D balances \\nthat develops.\\nAnd really what we're seeing between now and when we would have a new project come \\nonline is there is a limited net ammonia production that's coming online.\\nYou're seeing here in the US, you have the Gulf Coast ammonia that Bert mentioned, \\nwhich is not a low carbon, but you have the Woodside OCI plant, which we were \\nexpecting early 26.\\nAnd then outside of that, it's really not until 2028 where Qatar has a project \\nthat's announced.\\nSo long way to say we don't believe that the true projects that are moving forward \\nis really building that supply side.\\nAnd that's why Tony talks about as we see longer term a tightening in the S&D \\nmarket just under traditional application, let alone if we add in any type of clean\\nenergy demand to that.\\nGreat pleasure.\\nThank you.\\nThe next question comes from Ben Turrer with Barclays. Please go ahead.\\nGood morning and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a number of very strong\\nquarter.\\nJust a quick follow up as you think about the ammonia segment and the strength that\\nyou had in the quarter, which kind of was a little bit of a surprise on the \\nWilliams side.\\nI think at least there's hours and consensus estimate.\\nSo how do you think about just that segment itself, like not the Ferbour process, \\nbut the ammonia piece and the demand for that as you go into the fourth quarter and\\nmaybe a little bit related to Joel's question, just like the revenue piece that \\nthen translates into 4Q.\\nAnd as you move into it, how much volume can you actually produce and sell as \\nammonia now that you have back in mind?\\nWell, I would compare our products, ammonia, urea, ua, and d.e.f. ammonium nitrate.\\nWe love all our children.\\nAnd so ammonia is one of those segments and I got to give a shout out to the \\nammonia team of Amanda and Bob and Chiloh that have done a great job in the rest of\\nthe sales team this year.\\nThe interesting thing about CF, and I think this is one of the undervalued aspects \\nof our company, is the flexibility we have in our production locations, the \\nflexibility we have with our modes, which is truck, rail, pipe, or a vessel, and \\nthen our distribution system.\\nAnd so it's by leveraging all those points, then you could become agnostic on the \\nproduct and focused on the margin and what product creates the most margin at that \\ntime because our team is rewarded on the cost.\\nAnd so when we're working on the company's performance, we move tons freely between\\nthe segments, and if that segment, one segment is profiting more than the other, \\nand that's what you saw in ammonia with good demand globally.\\nSo we've been a fairly large exporter of tons out of Donaldsonville, and then that \\ncreates, again, optionality for the rest of the team.\\nOur volume, I think it's the exported ton that's the incremental increase, and then\\nas we go into Q4, that is the ammonia application season, and weather permitting, \\nour volume will be higher than Q3.\\nWe have a substantial book already built, and those values are in the publications,\\nwe're well within those ranges, and I think this year could be a fairly big year \\nfor fall ammonia because it's a very good agronomic product for a company.\\nAnd it's a very good product for a corn farmer in these dense organic soils of the \\nMidwest.\\nSo I think the ammonia position for CF is solid, and how much product can we put in\\n\\n\\n\\nthat segment?\\nIt's traditionally been around 4 million tons, but it could be 3.5 to 4 million \\ntons any given year.\\nPerfect. Thanks for that clarification.\\nThank you.\\nThe next question comes from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\\nSo today we look at Europe generally as the marginal cost producer, but we're also \\nseeing some changes in that region.\\nThere's capacity that's maybe shutting down, and that could reduce how much you \\ncontribute to that cost curve, but there's also CBAM that gets implemented in 2026,\\nwhich raises the cost position. So I'm just curious how you think about Europe as \\nthat marginal cost producer as you go forward and look out a couple years from now.\\nYeah. So Andrew, as we talked about before, this past summer, we did a pretty in-\\ndepth analysis of what's happening in Europe because we're seeing it much the way \\nyou described it,\\ngiven the cost of energy and the differential, which now sits at $10 and really \\ngoes there through 2026, that it's going to be very difficult for European \\nproducers who are not integrated to continue to produce ammonia.\\nAnd you saw that last week with one of our peers shutting down an ammonia plant \\njust to do upgrade, very similar to what we did with our UK ammonia plants.\\nSo we expect that to continue, and by 2030, we would see that there'd probably be \\nanother 3 to 4 million nutrient tons of imports required in Europe.\\nNow, some of that will take the form of upgraded products. Some of it will be just \\ngross ammonia that's going over there for upgrades through their tourmaline system \\ninto those products.\\nSo we see that specifically with our low carbon, because with the CBAM, as you \\nmentioned, if we have low carbon product and we're competing against conventional, \\nthe conventional cost is going to be higher, and that'll provide us a margin \\nadvantage as the CBAM goes into effect at the end of next year.\\nAnd really, by 2034, where there's no free allowances offered anymore, you could \\nsee that differential between someone who has an ATR that's sequestering 95% in a \\nconventional, is something that could be $150 per metric ton benefit.\\nSo it's that really sort of look, although we don't build that into our modeling. \\nIt is something that provides us, Tony, talked about us being a fast mover and \\nhaving that carbon arbitrage opportunity as we see Europe begin to contract some on\\nproduction.\\nOkay, that's really helpful in Europe. And then I guess that kind of brings in \\nanother question on just how does that global cost or look like three or four years\\nfrom now with the changes in Europe, Chinese exports, impacts from clean ammonia, \\ngiven how the SMD looks like, how does that change?\\nBecause you've seen different changes in the past decade or so, like, how does that\\nlook like three or four years from now?\\nWell, if price doesn't bid in that higher cost production and there's new demand \\ncoming on, you'll see probably a lowering of the cost curve to some extent.\\nAnd that's really why when we look at our particular project, we want it to be \\nintegrated because we think having the lowest op-ex related to some of these \\nprojects where you're buying hydrogen over the fence\\nand then upgrading it later still puts you in the third or fourth quartile of \\nproduction so you're no different than a European producer.\\nBut we do see that demand growth, so you're going to continue to need to see new \\nsupply come on and we do not believe that new supply meets demand.\\nSo some of these high-cost assets that you may think are going away are probably \\ngoing to remain online until we have some sort of balance between SMD.\\nOkay, thank you.\\nThank you.\\nThe next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\\nThank you, and good morning, everyone.\\nTony, I just wanted to follow up with you on the perspective blue ammonia facility.\\n\\n\\n\\nJust get your latest thoughts in terms of what you're seeking in terms of terms.\\nI recall you want to own at least 50% of it.\\nBut is anything changing in terms of how many partners you want to bring in both in\\nterms of the amount of equity they would want to provide?\\nOr do you have more of a willingness now maybe to fund it yourself but just have \\noff-take for a very large percentage of the plant?\\nOr is there anything evolving in sort of your own thought process or what the other\\nor what the counterparties are interested in doing?\\nYeah, I would say in general we have more interest than probably percentage of \\nequity to dole out.\\nAnd initially we were focused on or structured an agreement around 52% equity.\\nI could see a scenario that would have us take less than 50% total equity based on \\nthe desires of a couple of the partners we're talking to.\\nWe would want operating control and voting control in that kind of joint venture \\nscenario.\\nBut it's entirely possible that we would end up kind of at or below 50% of the \\ntotal equity.\\nI wouldn't want to go too much lower than that because we are putting our \\norganizational expertise and effort to really take on the design and the build and \\nthe construction and then the ongoing operation of the plant.\\nSo we want there to be enough participation in a project like that to make it worth\\nour while to put all that time and effort into it.\\nBut I think from a standpoint of having strong partners that want the off take that\\nbring good expertise and capital into the project and reduce our risk profile, \\nwe're really optimistic about this project and what it looks like going forward.\\nAnd just as a follow up, how are you thinking about Henry hub prices, not in the \\nnext 12 months, but you look out 12, 24, 36 months, you know, you get all this LNG \\ncoming in the US.\\nWe've got electricity increasing demand wise from data centers and everything else.\\nAny thoughts there?\\nIf the spreads are actual the strip, you're well into 2026 and you're still at $3.\\nAnd so the differential to the world, not necessarily the Henry hub price because \\nif the Henry hub goes to $6, but the spread goes to 10 or 50 or continues in the \\n$10 to $15 range, that just makes those other producers that are having to use \\nimported LNG that much more expensive.\\nSo when you look around the world where gas is, where gas is available and how that\\ngas is going to move, the United States plays a substantial role in that.\\nAnd we've demonstrated we as a country that when it was going from 70 to 90 to 100 \\nto 105 BCF per day of production, that there's additional capacity out there to \\ngrow as the LNG demand grows.\\nYes, LNG is going to go from, let's say, 14, 15, 16 BCF a day up into the 20s.\\nBut we anticipate that supply to be there as well.\\nAnd the cost structure today to tap those wells and to bring that production online\\nis still very attractive.\\nAnd so, yes, I think energy demand you're seeing that spread apart or spread across\\nwhether it's renewable or now bringing a new killer back.\\nSo it's going to be something interesting to watch, I think, more as we get later \\nin the decade.\\nThanks, guys.\\nThank you.\\nThe next question comes from Jeff Zicoskis with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\\nThanks very much.\\nWhen you think about the Donaldsonville dehydration and compression unit and the \\n45Q credits that you might get in 25,\\nit is your base case that the credits would come from enhanced oil recovery.\\nSo our agreement with Exxon is for CCS, so it is not for enhanced oil recovery.\\nSo it's for a class six permit in which it would be sequestered and we had received\\nthe $85 per metric ton tax grant related to that.\\nAnd as I said earlier, we still feel confident that next year we'll be sequestering\\n\\n\\n\\nin class six permits given the flexibility and really the alternatives that Exxon \\nhas across both Louisiana and Texas with different sequestration permits that are \\nin process right now,\\nboth with the state of Louisiana, but also with the EPA and the federal government.\\nSo I don't think ExxonMobil has completed any permit filings in Louisiana just yet.\\nSo why are you, and in Texas, you need EPA approval?\\nAnd this is just for the permits itself.\\nI mean, there have been no class six permits that have even been issued.\\nAre you really so confident that you can achieve this in 2025?\\nYeah, I would say.\\nAnd the OR area.\\nYeah.\\nSo what I would say is, Jeff, is as you point out, you know, there is in Texas, it \\nis federal and they do have sequestration wells that they have permits put in place\\nfor Texas as well.\\nAnd that's really where the optionality of that almost thousand mile CO2 pipeline \\nthat Denver, they acquired from Denver, allows them to work different paths and \\ndifferent alternatives to get there.\\nAll our discussions with Exxon suggest that they will have class six permitting, so\\nthat's what I'm basing it on.\\nAnd when you contemplate the building of a new blue ammonia facility and you look \\nat an ATR versus an SMR with flu gas capture, are those very different costs?\\nLike, is there a, I don't know, a billion dollar difference between doing one or \\ndoing the other?\\nOr is it much smaller?\\nIt's much smaller by the time you add on potential flu gas capture.\\nI think what you'd end up seeing is numbers that would kind of be in the proximate \\nrange of each other.\\nI think one of the big differences that you end up with is more tonnage of \\nproduction coming out of an ATR in general than the SMR.\\nYou know, the largest onion plant in the world is Donaldsonville number six.\\nAnd even though it's, name plate is the same size as a number of other plants that \\nare out there, we're getting about 10% or a little over 10% additional production \\nabove name plate.\\nAnd so that is the, you know, currently the largest plant in the world.\\nAnd the ATR would be quite a bit larger than that plant even.\\nAnd so one of the benefits is the ATR is compared to the SMR with flu gas is on a \\ncomparable capital basis.\\nYou get more tonnage of production and all those incremental tons are really at \\nvariable cost.\\nAnd so the return profile looks really attractive against those incremental tons.\\nSo that's kind of the direction that we're targeting.\\nThe other part I would add, Jeff, is based on that incremental tons, which could be\\n10% higher than our ammonia sixes.\\nYou're now also capturing, you know, probably about 50% more CO2 than you would on \\na comparable conventional SMR.\\nAnd you'd be obtaining the 45Q, whether it be through the class six or an EOR, \\nyou'd have a benefit that would be significant over what a traditional SMR plant \\nwould be.\\nOkay, great. Thank you very much.\\nThank you.\\nThe next question comes from Adlaine Rodriguez with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\\nAdlaine Rodriguez in the line has been unmuted. You may proceed with your question.\\nSorry about that. Good morning, everyone. Tony, a quick one for you. Can you talk \\nabout changes if any you see in farmers or retailers' behavior,\\ngiven the more challenging crop prices we have now, and how has that changed?\\nHow does CS go-to market behavior have changed accordingly?\\nYeah, I'll give a real quick high-level answer, and I'll begin it over to Bert to \\ngive some additional color.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in general, because nitrogen is a non-discretionary nutrient, we've seen strong\\ndemand for our product globally, even though crop prices are a little more muted \\ntoday than they were a year ago or two years ago,\\nI think generally where you see farmer behavior looking to be different in an \\nevolving crop price marketplace has to do with some of the other inputs.\\nSo whether it's PMK that you might cut back on a little bit, or you end up going \\nwith a generic feed, and chemicals as opposed to some of the ones that are still on\\npatent, et cetera,\\nyou see the reduction in costs in other places, but nitrogen really doesn't provide\\nan option for farmers to reduce otherwise you see a direct year-one impact on \\nyield.\\nSo that's why we continue to see very strong demand for our product.\\nYeah, I agree with Tony, and some of the interesting things that are going on in \\nthe farm community, and we're very well connected with our customers.\\nWe don't sell to farmers, but the co-ops that we work with, Gromark, CHS, \\nWindfield, and some of the others, as well as our public companies and private \\ncompanies, Simplot and ADM and people like that, we have a lot of conversations.\\nAnd I think one of the issues is that it needs to be managed on the farmer's side \\nis debt and cash management, and so you're seeing delayed purchases, delayed \\npurchases, and positioning for the spring.\\nAnd I think one of the things like Tony talked about all the ancillary issues of \\nproducts that are used for planting and growing a crop, it's land values as well.\\nSo we're going to have to watch that over time, but for us, it's we focus on what \\nwe can control, and that's lowering our costs, keeping our costs attractive as \\nrelated to the market in terms of our production mix, running the plants very well \\nand efficient,\\nand utilizing the export capabilities that we have for a global participant, we're \\nactive in Brazil, Argentina, Australia, and Europe,\\nand that gives us insight into global farming practices and needs, and then we \\nmanage our book. We always have a healthy book on and then a manager of the pricing\\nthat's available to us, so we're capturing a good value and the gas team,\\nand keeping our gas costs low, which have been, they've done a very good job. So in\\nconjunction with our insight into the market, our relationships in the market,\\nour capabilities that we are able to leverage were positioned very well, and I \\nthink the farmer with some of the droughts that are going on in Brazil and some of \\nthe demand and low prices tend to help demand increase.\\nThe pricing will recover, hopefully in the forward market.\\nOkay, that makes sense. And a related question, as we exit 2024 and enter in 2025, \\nagain, it seems like the way you talk about the outlook for nitrogen, that's very \\nencouraging.\\nIs there anything that concerns you at all like anything that makes you think, \\nyeah, keeps you awake?\\nI sleep very well, but there are things in this market that I do think about, and \\nI'm always looking over the horizon on, I think there are issues with currencies on\\nwhat countries are devaluing their currency in order to participate.\\nI think some of the things that are coming out of China with export policies, \\nindustrial policies have ramifications into the commodity markets.\\nI think some of the concerns with Europe and gas were a producer in the UK, and so \\nwe're following that market.\\nWe have good customers and what their long-term opportunities are, or challenges.\\nAnd then it's geopolitics or the geopolitical environment that we're currently in \\nwith what's going on in the Middle East, what's going on in Ukraine.\\nYou know, these have impacts on real people and real decisions on not just how \\npeople eat, but how they live, and then how do we play in that world.\\nSo, yes, there are concerns. I think we always have to be mindful of those things \\nin the energy markets and how we run our business.\\nOkay, thank you very much.\\nThank you.\\nThe next question is from Demetri Silverstein with Water Tower Research. Please go \\n\\n\\n\\nahead.\\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my questions.\\nMost of them have been answered, but I do want to follow up on the more near-term \\noutlook for pricing.\\nWe've seen price comping down you over your in the first half of the year, and then\\nyou reported a price increase here in the third quarter.\\nHow do you look at, given the market dynamics and the tightness in the market that \\nyou identified and talked about, what do you expect for pricing as you get into the\\n2025 negotiated season?\\nWell, a lot of things that drive pricing drive, it's supply and demand, it's energy\\nspreads, it's, again, some of the issues I just articulated.\\nWe did have some weakness going into Q1 and then coming out of Q2, or pricing for \\nEurea, for example, fell NOLA to $290, and then recovered to $330, $335, and we're \\ncurrently trading around $320.\\nAnd so the trends in pricing were reflective of the lack of Chinese availability, \\nthe lack of North African, principally Egypt, and then some other gas constrained \\nareas.\\nAnd we see that positive environment continuing into Q2 because of those dynamics \\nare not going away.\\nAnd so we have these episodic moments of movements of pricing, but the trend, we \\nbelieve, through at least the first half of 2025 is positive.\\nThat's awful. Thank you. And then one final question. You mentioned the modest \\nhurricane impact from fame scene.\\nI'm hoping that nothing else was impacted as far as your operations concerned with \\nthe East Coast strike.\\nAnything we should be thinking about in terms of cost, deltas going forward as far \\nas logistics costs, the barge traffic in Mississippi is still kind of slow because \\nof the low water levels after a couple of years of droughts.\\nAnything that we should be keeping in mind as we look towards 2025 on your gross \\nmargin line.\\nYeah. So what I would say is a lot of those we were able to mitigate those issues \\nthat you mentioned with the porch strike and then also the hurricane without really\\nmuch financial cost related to that.\\nI think just in general with any type of logistics movement, what we're seeing is \\njust the inflationary effects, both from, you know, barge prices or whether it be \\nrail.\\nSo that, I would say, is the one area we continue to monitor and look at \\nalternatives.\\nYou know, the one thing that we have flexibility that differentiates us from other \\ncompanies is our ability specifically out of Donald's ability to move product \\nthrough five different modes, whether it be vessel, barge, truck, rail, or pipe.\\nAnd that gives us a lot of flexibility to go to alternative transport methods.\\nSo I would say it's just, you know, Bert's team in the supply chain doing a little \\nbit more thought provoking just to keep costs down versus what we're seeing \\ninflation wise.\\nI'm just so. Thank you very much. That's all the questions ahead.\\nThank you.\\nLadies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions for today.\\nI would like to turn the call back to Martin J. Rosen for closing remarks.\\nThanks everyone for joining us. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming \\nconferences.\\nThank you. The conference has now concluded.\\nThank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\\n\\n\\n\""
